https://youtu.be/xzI5-U4S6AE,00:00:12.000,00:00:22.000," Unfortunately, the ship got caught in a storm on the high seas and it was getting tossed by the waves."
https://youtu.be/xzI5-U4S6AE,00:00:23.000,00:00:29.000, Everybody in that ship was anxious except for the sailor.
https://youtu.be/xzI5-U4S6AE,00:00:30.000,00:00:36.000," His wife, looking at his calm demeanor said, my dear husband,"
https://youtu.be/xzI5-U4S6AE,00:00:36.000,00:00:42.000, how are you so calm in such a difficult situation?
https://youtu.be/xzI5-U4S6AE,00:00:43.000,00:00:52.000," He smiled, he took out his sword from the sheath and placed the blade on his wife's head."
https://youtu.be/xzI5-U4S6AE,00:00:53.000,00:00:57.000," He said, my dear wife, are you worried?"
https://youtu.be/xzI5-U4S6AE,00:00:57.000,00:01:06.000," She said, no, why not? This naked blade is on your head, it can go right through your skull."
https://youtu.be/xzI5-U4S6AE,00:01:06.000,00:01:13.000," She said, it's in your hands, the sword and I have faith that you are my well-wisher."
https://youtu.be/xzI5-U4S6AE,00:01:13.000,00:01:17.000, What's there to be scared about?
https://youtu.be/xzI5-U4S6AE,00:01:17.000,00:01:24.000," The naval officer said, in the same way, I have faith that this ship is on the hands of God"
https://youtu.be/xzI5-U4S6AE,00:01:24.000,00:01:31.000, and whatever he does will be for my best interest because he is my well-wisher.
https://youtu.be/xzI5-U4S6AE,00:01:32.000,00:01:42.000, That faith frees us from anxieties of the present and helps us focus on doing our best.
https://youtu.be/xzI5-U4S6AE,00:01:42.000,00:01:49.000, And that ultimately is the way for building our future.
https://youtu.be/xzI5-U4S6AE,00:01:49.000,00:01:56.000," So rather than worry about the future, we can simplify the game of life."
https://youtu.be/xzI5-U4S6AE,00:01:56.000,00:02:03.000, Do your best and leave to God on the rest.
